# dexter

`dexter` is a OIDC (OpenId Connect) helper to create a hassle-free Kubernetes login experience powered by Google or Azure as Identity Provider.
All you need is a properly configured Google or Azure client ID & secret.

## Supported identity providers

| Identity Provider  | State    |
|--------------------|----------|
|  Google            | complete |
|  Microsoft Azure   | complete |

## Authentication Flow

`dexter` will open a new browser tag/window and redirect you to your configured Idp. The only interaction you have is the login at your provider and your k8s config is updated automatically.

## OIDCProvider Configuration

Each OpenID Connect provider requires some configuration. This basic
description may not be all you have to do but it worked at the time of
writing.

### Google

  - Open [console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com)
  - Create new credentials
    - OAuth Client ID
    - Web Application
    - Authorized redirect URIs: http://127.0.0.1:64464/callback

### Microsoft Azure

  - Open [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
  - Go to Appregistrations and create a new app
    - Enter reply URI http://127.0.0.1:64464/callback
    - Create secret key
    - Collect  application ID (client ID)

### Auto pilot configuration

`dexter` also support auto pilot mode. If your existing kubectl context uses one of the supported Identity Providers, `dexter` will try to use extract the OIDC data from kubeconfig.

## Installation

You can download a prebuilt version from the [Github release section](https://github.com/gini/dexter/releases) or build it yourself.
The easiest way to get everything set up correctly (e.g. ldflags) is to use [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com).

```
# cd DEXTER_SOURCE
# goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
• releasing...
• loading config file       file=.goreleaser.yml
• loading environment variables
• getting and validating git state
   • building...               commit=377677a03da17461acf7775519518fb3336e6753 latest tag=v0.4.1

   • running                   hook=go mod tidy
• setting defaults
• snapshotting
   • building snapshot...      version=0.4.2-next

   • --rm-dist is set, cleaning it up
• loading go mod information

   • writing                   config=dist/config.yaml

   • building                  binary=dist/dexter_darwin_amd64/dexter
   • building                  binary=dist/dexter_linux_amd64/dexter
• universal binaries
   • creating from 2 binaries  binary=dist/dexter_darwin_all/dexter
• archives
   • creating                  archive=dist/dexter_0.4.2-next_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
   • creating                  archive=dist/dexter_0.4.2-next_Darwin_all.tar.gz
• calculating checksums
• storing release metadata
   • writing                   file=dist/artifacts.json
   • writing                   file=dist/metadata.json
• release succeeded after 8.18s
```

Check `./dist` for the build that matches your platform.

### Embed credentials and template

You can also customize the build and embed client credentails and a default kubectl config into the binary. Again, using `goreleaser` for the build is the easiest approach.
Client credentials are embedded automatically when you set two environment variables.

```
CLIENT_ID=abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com
CLIENT_SECRET=mySecret
```

You can streamline your user experience even more by also specifying a default provider. `dexter auth` will then run the specified provider.
Valid choices are `google` and `azure`.

```
DEFAULT_PROVIDER=google
```

If you want to to change the default config template that is deployed when there is no config on the system you have to replace the contents of `./tmpl/kube-config.yaml` with your valid kubectl configuration.
This can come in handy if you want to pre-populate clusters and certificates.

```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: XXX
    server: https://stage.cluster:6443
  name: stage
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: YYY
    server: https://production.cluster:6443
  name: production
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: stage
    user: {{ .User }}
  name: stage
- context:
    cluster: production
    user: {{ .User }}
  name: production
current-context: stage
kind: Config
preferences: {}
```

Please make sure that you have `{{ .User }}` in all contexts that need you want to enrich with the OIDC account you are about to configure.

## Run dexter
